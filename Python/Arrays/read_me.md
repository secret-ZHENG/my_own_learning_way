This is my test and learn note about array! I record what I read, look, watch and try.  
# forcus on Jwasham's asked ability   
Implement a vector (mutable array with automatic resizing):
## 1. Practice coding using arrays and pointers, and pointer math to jump to an index instead of using indexing.➡️C++
* comprehension  : python do not have explicit pointer
### First way: using *bytearray* and *memoryview*

## 2. New raw data array with allocated memory

## 3.comprehension of code
* size()-number of items   
* capacity()-number of items it can hold   
* is_empty()-check whether a data structure contains no elements
* at(index) - returns the item at a given index, blows up if index out of bounds
*
