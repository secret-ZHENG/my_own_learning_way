# my_own_learning_way   
It is a record of my path of being a programer.     
## my thinking about Code    
This is my thinking and will change by my thoughts. I always feel confused and don't know how to learn. So I record my changing thought and hope it will be helpful.   
From begin, I don't know to write in github, how to create file and how to decide the type  of file.
As i keep learn on youtobe, and find many ways or websites or courses that teach code. Then I decide to learn Font as start, because it is said simple than others.   
Meanwhile, I follow Jwasham's path who get hired and learn by himself and be a software development engineer as Amazon.   
The URL is - [ ] [*Coding Interview University*] (https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university?tab=readme-ov-file#data-structures)   
I learn the basic syntax about python. For me I think it is easy to begin and understand the loop. 

### Day 000    
#### Algorithmic complexity/Big-O
*(The four below video is what I already learned by following Jwasham's way)(The four can find in [__Coding Interview University__]  ) *
- [ ] [Harvard CS50 - Asymptotic Notation (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOq5kSKqeR4)
- [ ] [Big O Notations (general quick tutorial) (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6mKVRU1evU)
- [ ] [Big O Notation (and Omega and Theta) - best mathematical explanation (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei-A_wy5Yxw&index=2&list=PL1BaGV1cIH4UhkL8a9bJGG356covJ76qN)

Book:
1. 《我的第一本算法书》  (https://book.cppinfo.cn/Encyclopedias/home/index?id=3792646)   
I find a book about algorithmic in Chinese. It helps me to understand these and the book is simple.

#### What I learned  
1.Big-O explain time complexity which is used to describe running time of algorithmic.

#### Data Structure  
##### Arrays   

## Book   
### Already done book
#### Reading book
1. 《Elements  of  Programming  Interviews in Python》


### Day 001
#### 1. reading book 《Elements  of  Programming  Interviews in Python》-Arrays-P7-8  
1. in-place algorithm : even_odd arrays  
##### My question:
1. what is without extra storage  
   techniacl requirments:
    a.operate directly on the input data structure  
    b.constant extra storage  
    c.no data duplication
   When to use :
    1.memory is scarce
    2.data size is huge
    3.performance-critical
    4.temporary transformation- no need of original data
    5.intermediate step
2.
