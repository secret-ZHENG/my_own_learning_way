# my_own_learning_way   
It is a record of my path of being a programer.     
## my thinking about Code    
This is my thinking and will change by my thoughts. I always feel confused and don't know how to learn. So I record my changing thought and hope it will be helpful.   
From begin, I don't know to write in github, how to create file and how to decide the type  of file.
As i keep learn on youtobe, and find many ways or websites or courses that teach code. Then I decide to learn Font as start, because it is said simple than others.   
Meanwhile, I follow Jwasham's path who get hired and learn by himself and be a software development engineer as Amazon.        
I learn the basic syntax about python. For me I think it is easy to begin and understand the loop.
